## Introduction to Redux

### What is Redux, and why is it used?
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is commonly used to manage the state of an application in a centralized store, enabling predictable state updates and easier debugging. Redux is especially useful for large-scale applications where state management becomes complex.

**Diagram:**
```
Components <--> Actions --> Reducer --> Store --> Components
```

### What are the three core principles of Redux?
1. **Single Source of Truth**: The state of the entire application is stored in a single object called the store.
2. **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action.
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.

**Diagram:**
```
+------------------+
|   Redux Store    |
+------------------+
       ^
       |
+------------------+
| Reducers (Pure) |
+------------------+
       ^
       |
+------------------+
|    Actions       |
+------------------+
```

### How does Redux differ from the Context API in React?
Redux provides a more structured way to manage state with features like middleware, immutability enforcement, and dev tools for debugging. Context API is simpler and best suited for lightweight state management without advanced features.

## Core Concepts

### What is the role of actions in Redux?
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe the type of operation to be performed and the data required for it.

Example:
```javascript
{
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  payload: 1
}
```

### Explain the structure of a Redux reducer.
A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.

Example:
```javascript
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

### What is the purpose of the store in Redux?
The store holds the state of the application and provides methods to dispatch actions and subscribe to state changes.

**Diagram:**
```
Action --> Reducer --> Store --> UI
```

## Middleware

### What is middleware in Redux?
Middleware is a function that sits between the dispatch of an action and the reducer. It allows you to intercept actions and perform side effects like logging or making API calls.

### How does middleware like Redux Thunk enhance Redux?
Redux Thunk allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, enabling delayed or conditional dispatching of actions.

Example:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    fetch('api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data }));
  };
};
```

## Advanced Topics

### What are selectors in Redux, and how are they used?
Selectors are functions that extract specific data from the state.

Example:
```javascript
const getCompletedTodos = (state) => state.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
```

### How do you optimize performance in a large Redux application?
- Use memoization with selectors.
- Normalize the state structure.
- Use `React.memo` and `useSelector` efficiently.

## Practical Scenarios

### How would you implement authentication using Redux?
1. Dispatch an action to log in.
2. Store the token in the Redux state.
3. Use middleware to attach the token to API requests.

**Diagram:**
```
Login Form --> Dispatch Action --> Reducer --> Store
```

### How do you handle asynchronous actions in Redux?
By using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.

### Describe a use case where Redux might not be the best choice.
For small applications with simple state management, Redux may be overkill, and Context API or local state may suffice.
